# Detection system for fire, suffocation, and burn
This repository contains a simulation process used in the paper entitled "FSB-System: A Detection System for Fire, Suffocation, and Burn Based on Fuzzy Decision Making, MCDM, and RGB Model in Wireless Sensor Networks" published by Springer on 25 March 2019.
<br/>
<br/>
## Application
The repository includes three applications: FFC, SFC and BFC.
<br/>
<br/>
FFC is the simulation process of the fire application using fire fuzzy controller, SFC is the simulation of the suffocation application using suffocation fuzzy controller, and BFC is the simulation of the burn application using burn fuzzy controller.
<br/>
<br/>
## Programming language
The programs are developed in MATLAB.
